# CAA-Race

Stripped back version of the unreal engine (4.27) game used during the outreach activities on the charge around australia project. School children would play various games to generate 'energy' which is transferred to their team's car using a 3D printed disc housing an RFID tag inside it. Serial ports are then used to interface with the game and increase the car's energy (implemented using SERIALCOM_UE427)

Up to four players can run at once, with each Tesla having a different colour.

Designed to be used with the 'Rural Australia' pack created by Andrew Svanberg Hamilton ( https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/rural-australia ), but a more basic level is included here to keep the memory down
